### Compiling on OpenBSD

* 	Need to set specific environment variables for AUTOCONF_VERSION and AUTOMAKE_VERSION
* 	For testing:
	* You need OpenDKIM installed from source for "miltertest"
	* You need to install Lua first, and modify OpenDKIM's configure.ac to find the lua libs
	  in /usr/local/lib/lua/5.1
	* You need to fully install OpenDKIM, as miltertest needs an OpenDKIM lib.
./configure --with-spf --with-spf2-include=/usr/local/include/spf2 --with-spf2-lib=/usr/local/lib --enable-live-tests --enable-filter-tests USE_SPF=TRUE CC=clang
