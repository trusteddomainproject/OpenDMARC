For basic processing of an arriving message under
<b>Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance</b>
("DMARC"), make the following calls:

<ol>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_policy_library_init.html">opendmarc_policy_library_init(&amp;lib)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> initialize an instance of the library
       <li> this must be done once before any of the other calls are made
       <li> this needs to be called once when the application is started,
            but its result can be reused at the start of processing of each
            message
      </ul>
 <li> <tt>dmarc = <a href="opendmarc_policy_connect_init.html">opendmarc_policy_connect_init(ip-address, ip-version)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> initialize a handle set up for signing all messages from a new
            connection
       <li> establishes the context needed for evaluating SPF
       <li> the handle returned here can be used for all messages that arrive
            from the given IP address; simply call
            <a href="opendmarc_policy_connect_rset.html">opendmarc_policy_connect_rset()</a>
            between each message
       <li> each thread must request its own handle for processing messages
      </ul>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_policy_store_from_domain.html">opendmarc_policy_store_from_domain(dmarc, domain)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> store the domain name found in the From: field of an arriving
            message
      </ul>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_policy_store_spf.html">opendmarc_policy_store_spf(dmarc, ...)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> stores the SPF result details for the current message once they
            are available from some other API
      </ul>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_policy_store_dkim.html">opendmarc_policy_store_dkim(dmarc, ...)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> stores a set of DKIM result details for the current message once
            they are available from some other API
       <li> this can be called multiple times per message since a single
            message can have multiple DKIM signatures attached to it
      </ul>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_policy_query_dmarc.html">opendmarc_policy_query_dmarc(dmarc)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> performs DMARC policy query and evaluation on the message based
            on details provided above
      </ul>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_get_policy_to_enforce.html">opendmarc_get_policy_to_enforce(dmarc)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> report the policy in effect over the From: domain found in the
	    message; indicates what the final disposition of the current
            message should be
      </ul>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_policy_connect_shutdown.html">opendmarc_policy_connect_shutdown(dmarc)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> shuts down the previously allocated handle
      </ul>
 <li> <tt><a href="opendmarc_policy_library_shutdown.html">opendmarc_policy_library_shutdown(lib)</a>;</tt>
      <ul>
       <li> free resources related to the library
      </ul>
</ol> <br>
