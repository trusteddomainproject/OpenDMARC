.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendmarc
implements the proposed
.B DMARC
specification for authentication of message and reporting of observed
traffic.

.B opendmarc
uses the
.I milter
interface, originally distributed as part of version 8.11 of
.B sendmail(8),
to provide a DMARC processing service for mail transiting
a milter-aware MTA.

Most, if not all, of the command line options listed below can also be set
using a configuration file.  See the
.I \-c
option for details.

.B opendmarc
relies on addition of Authentication-Results fields by upsteam filters on
trusted hosts to collect input to the DMARC algorithm.  It does not itself
do DKIM or SPF evaluation.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-A
Automatically re-start on failures.  Use with caution; if the filter
fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a tight
.I fork(2)
loop.  This can be mitigated using some values in the configuration file
to limit restarting.  See
.I opendmarc.conf(5).
.TP
.I \-c configfile
Read the named configuration file.  See the
.I opendmarc.conf(5)
man page for details.  Values in the configuration file are overridden
when their equivalents are provided on the command line until a configuration
reload occurs.  The OPERATION section describes how reloads are triggered.
The default is to read a configuration file from
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/opendmarc.conf
if one exists, or otherwise to apply defaults to all values.
.TP
.I \-f
Normally
.I opendmarc
forks and exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
This flag suppresses that behaviour so that it runs in the foreground.
.TP
.I \-l
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
any interesting activity.
.TP
.I \-n
Parse the configuration file and command line arguments, reporting any
errors found, and then exit.  The exit value will be 0 if the filter would
start up without complaint, or non-zero otherwise.
.TP
.I \-p socketspec
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.I sendmail(8)
in order to provide service.
.I socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.I local:path
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.I path,
or
.I inet:port[@host]
or
.I inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.I port
within the specified protocol family.  If the
.I host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  If neither socket type is specified,
.I local
is assumed, meaning the parameter is interpreted as a path at which
the socket should be created.  If an IP address is used, it must be enclosed
in square brackets.  This parameter is mandatory.  
.TP
.I \-P pidfile
Specifies a file into which the filter should write its process ID at startup.
.TP
.I \-t file[,file[,...]]
Reads email messages from the named files and processes them as if they were
received by the filter.  The service is not started, and actions normally
sent back to the MTA will instead be printed on standard output.
.TP
.I \-u userid[:group]
Attempts to be come the specified
.I userid
before starting operations.  The process will be assigned all of the groups
and primary group ID of the named
.I userid
unless an alternate
.I group
is specified.  See the FILE PERMISSIONS section for more information.
.TP
.I \-v
Increase verbose output during test mode (see
.I \-t
above).  May be specified more than once to request increasing amounts of
output.
.TP
.I \-V
Print the version number and supported canonicalization and signature
algorithms, and then exit without doing anything else.
.SH SIGNALS
Upon receiving SIGUSR1, if the filter was started with a configuration
file, it will be re-read and the new values used.  Note that any
command line overrides provided at startup time will be lost when this is
done.  Also, the following configuration file values (and their corresponding
command line items, if any) are not reloaded through this process:
AutoRestart (\-A),
AutoRestartCount,
AutoRestartRate,
Background,
MilterDebug,
PidFile (\-P),
Socket (\-p),
UMask,
UserID (\-u).  The filter does not automatically check the configuration
file for changes and reload.
