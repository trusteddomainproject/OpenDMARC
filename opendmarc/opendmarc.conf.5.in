.SH NAME
.B opendmarc.conf
\- Configuration file for opendmarc

.SH LOCATION
.I @SYSCONFDIR@/opendmarc.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I opendmarc(8)
implements the proposed
.B DMARC
specification for message authentication, policy enforcement, and reporting.
This file is its configuration file.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines containing a hash ("#") character are
truncated at the hash character to allow for comments in the file.

Other content should be the name of a parameter, followed by white space,
followed by the value of that parameter, each on a separate line.

For parameters that are Boolean in nature, only the first byte of
the value is processed.  For positive values, the following are accepted:
"T", "t", "Y", "y", "1".  For negative values, the following are accepted:
"F", "f", "N", "n", "0".

Some, but not all, of these parameters are also available as command
line options to
.I opendmarc(8).
However, new parameters are generally not added as command line options
so the complete set of options is available here, and thus use of the
configuration file is encouraged.  In some future release, the
set of available command line options is likely to get trimmed.

See the 
.I opendmarc(8)
man page for details about how and when the configuration file contents
are reloaded.

Unless otherwise stated, Boolean values default to "false", integer values
default to 0, and string and dataset values default to being undefined.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I AuthservID (string)
Sets the "authserv-id" to use when generating the Authentication-Results:
header field after verifying a message.  The default is to use the name of
the MTA processing the message.  If the string "HOSTNAME" is provided, the
name of the host running the filter (as returned by the
.I gethostname(3)
function) will be used.

.TP
.I AuthservIDWithJobID (Boolean)
If "true", requests that the authserv-id portion of the added
Authentication-Results: header fields contain the job ID of the message being
evaluated.

.TP
.I AutoRestart (Boolean)
Automatically re-start on failures.  Use with caution; if the filter
fails instantly after it starts, this can cause a tight
.I fork(2)
loop.

.TP
.I AutoRestartCount (integer)
Sets the maximum automatic restart count.  After this number of
automatic restarts, the filter will give up and terminate.
A value of 0 implies no limit; this is the default.

.TP
.I AutoRestartRate (string)
Sets the maximum automatic restart rate.  If the filter begins restarting
faster than the rate defined here, it will give up and terminate.
This is a string of the form
.I n/t[u]
where
.I n
is an integer limiting the count of restarts in the given interval and
.I t[u]
defines the time interval through which the rate is calculated;
.I t
is an integer and
.I u
defines the units thus represented ("s" or "S" for seconds, the default;
"m" or "M" for minutes; "h" or "H" for hours; "d" or "D" for days).  For
example, a value of "10/1h" limits the restarts to 10 in one hour.  There
is no default, meaning restart rate is not limited.

.TP
.I Background (Boolean)
Causes
.I opendmarc
to fork and exits immediately, leaving the service running in the background.
The default is "true".

.TP
.I BaseDirectory (string)
If set, instructs the filter to change to the specified directory using
.I chdir(2)
before doing anything else.  This means any files referenced elsewhere
in the configuration file can be specified relative to this directory.
It's also useful for arranging that any crash dumps will be saved to
a specific location.

.TP
.I ChangeRootDirectory (string)
Requests that the operating system change the effective root directory
of the process to the one specified here prior to beginning execution.
.B chroot (2)
requires superuser access. A warning will be generated if
.I UserID
is not also set.

.TP
.I CopyFailuresTo (string)
Adds the specified recipient to the message's envelope if it fails the DMARC
evaluation.

.TP
.I DomainWhitelist (string)
A brief list of whitelisted domains for which ARC signature headers are
trusted as determined by evaluating entries in the "arc.chain" field found
in a locally generated Authentication-Results header.

This list will be concatenated with DomainWhitelistFile (if provided).

.TP
.I DomainWhitelistFile (string)
A comprehensive list of whitelisted domains for which ARC signature headers
are trusted as determined by evaluating entries in the "arc.chain" field
found in a locally generated Authentication-Results header.

This list will be concatenated with DomainWhitelist (if provided).

.TP
.I DomainWhitelistSize (integer)
Sets the capacity of the whitelisted domains data structure. The value specifies
the maximum number of entries including domains listed in the DomainWhitelist
configuration parameter and the domains listed in the DomainWhiteListFile. The
final size will be increased by approximately 20% to increase the efficiency of
the hashing algorithm.

.TP
.I DNSTimeout (integer)
Sets the DNS timeout in seconds.  A value of 0 causes an infinite wait.
The default is 5.  Ignored if not using an asynchronous resolver package.

.TP
.I EnableCoredumps (Boolean)
On systems that have such support, make an explicit request to the kernel
to dump cores when the filter crashes for some reason.  Some modern UNIX
systems suppress core dumps during crashes for security reasons if the
user ID has changed during the lifetime of the process.  Currently only
supported on Linux.

.TP
.I FailureReports (Boolean)
Enables generation of failure reports when the DMARC test fails and the
purported sender of the message has requested such reports.  Reports are
formatted per RFC6591.

.TP
.I FailureReportsBcc (string)
When failure reports are enabled and one is to be generated, always send one
to the address(es) specified here.  If a failure report is requested by
the domain owner, the address(es) are added in a Bcc: field.  If no request
is made, they address(es) are used in a To: field.  There is no default.

.TP
.I FailureReportsOnNone (Boolean)
Supplementary to the previous setting, enables generation of failure reports
for sending domains that publish a "none" policy.

.TP
.I FailureReportsSentBy (string)
Sets the value of the From: field to be used when sending failure reports
(see above).  The default is to use the userid of the user executing the
filter and the local host name to construct an email address.

.TP
.I HistoryFile (string)
If set, specifies the location of a text file to which records are written
that can be used to generate DMARC aggregate reports.  Records are
batches of rows containing information about a single received message,
and include all relevant information needed to generate a DMARC aggregate
report.  It is expected that this will not be used in its raw form, but
rather periodically imported into a relational database from which the
aggregate reports can be extracted using
.B opendmarc-importstats(8).

.TP
.I HoldQuarantinedMessages (Boolean)
If set, the milter will signal to the mta that messages with
p=quarantine, which fail dmarc authentication, should be held in
the MTA's "Hold" or "Quarantine" queue.  The name varies by MTA.
If false, messages will be accepted and passed along with the
regular mail flow, and the quarantine will be left up to downstream
MTA/MDA/MUA filters, if any, to handle by re-evaluating the headers,
including the Authentication-Results header added by this filter.
The default is "false".

.TP
.I IgnoreAuthenticatedClients (Boolean)
If set, causes mail from authenticated clients (i.e., those that used
SMTP AUTH) to be ignored by the filter.  The default is "false".

.TP
.I IgnoreHosts (string)
Specifies the path to a file that contains a list of hostnames, IP addresses,
and/or CIDR expressions identifying hosts whose SMTP connections are to be
ignored by the filter.  If not specified, defaults to "127.0.0.1" only.

.TP
.I IgnoreMailFrom (string)
Gives a list of domain names whose mail (based on the From: domain) is to
be ignored by the filter.  The list should be comma-separated.  Matching
against this list is case-insensitive.  The default is an empty list, meaning
no mail is ignored.

.TP
.I MilterDebug (integer)
Sets the debug level to be requested from the milter library.  The
default is 0.

.TP
.I PidFile (string)
Specifies the path to a file that should be created at process start
containing the process ID.

.TP
.I PublicSuffixList (string)
Specifies the path to a file that contains top-level domains (TLDs) that
will be used to compute the Organizational Domain for a given domain name,
as described in the DMARC specification.  If not provided, the filter will
not be able to determine the Organizational Domain and only the presented
domain will be evaluated.  This file should be periodically updated.
One location to retrieve the file from is https://publicsuffix.org/list/

.TP
.I RecordAllMessages (Boolean)
If set and
.I HistoryFile
is in use, all received messages are recorded to the history file.  If not set
(the default), only messages for which the From: domain published a DMARC
record will be recorded in the history file.

.TP
.I RejectFailures (Boolean)
If set, messages will be rejected if they fail the DMARC evaluation, or
temp-failed if evaluation could not be completed.  By default, no message will
be rejected or temp-failed regardless of the outcome of the DMARC evaluation of
the message.  Instead, an Authentication-Results header field will be added.
The default is "false".

.TP
.I RejectMultiValueFrom (Boolean)
If set, messages with multiple addresses in the From: field of the message
will be rejected unless all domain names in that field are the same.  They
will otherwise be ignored by the filter (the default).

.TP
.I ReportCommand (string)
Indicates the shell command to which failure reports should be passed for
delivery when
.I FailureReports
is enabled.  Defaults to
.I /usr/sbin/sendmail.

.TP
.I RequiredHeaders (Boolean)
If set, the filter will ensure the header of the message conforms to the basic
header field count restrictions laid out in RFC5322, Section 3.6.  Messages
failing this test are rejected without further processing.  A From:
field from which no domain name could be extracted will also be rejected.

.TP
.I Socket (string)
Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
connections from
.I sendmail(8)
in order to provide service.
.I socketspec
is in one of two forms:
.I local:path,
which creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified
.I path,
or
.I inet:port[@host]
or
.I inet6:port[@host]
which creates a TCP socket on the specified
.I port
for the appropriate protocol family.  If the
.I host
is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be
listening on all interfaces.  This option is mandatory either in the
configuration file or on the command line.  If an IP address is used,
it must be enclosed in square brackets.

.TP
.I SoftwareHeader (Boolean)
Causes
.I opendmarc
to add a "DMARC-Filter" header field indicating the presence of this filter in
the path of the message from injection to delivery.  The product's name,
version, and the job ID are included in the header field's contents.

.TP
.I SPFIgnoreResults (Boolean)
Causes the filter to ignore any SPF results in the header of the
message.  This is useful if you want the filter to perform SPF checks
itself, or because you don't trust the arriving header.  The default is "false".

.TP
.I SPFSelfValidate (Boolean)
Causes the filter to perform a fallback SPF check itself when
it can find no SPF results in the message header.  If SPFIgnoreResults
is also set, it never looks for SPF results in headers and
always performs the SPF check itself when this is set.  The default is "false".

.TP
.I Syslog (Boolean)
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
any interesting activity.

.TP
.I SyslogFacility (string)
Log via calls to
.I syslog(3)
using the named facility.  The facility names are the same as the ones
allowed in
.I syslog.conf(5).
The default is "mail".

.TP
.I TrustedAuthservIDs (string)
Provides a list of authserv-ids that are to be used to identify
Authentication-Results header fields whose contents are to be assumed as valid
input for the DMARC assessment.  To provide a list, separate values by commas.
If the string "HOSTNAME" is provided, the name of the host running the filter
(as returned by the
.I gethostname(3)
function) will be used.  Matching against this list is case-insensitive.  The
default is to use the value of
.I AuthservID.

.TP
.I UMask (integer)
Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation.
This only really applies to creation of the socket when
.I Socket
specifies a UNIX domain socket, and to the
.I PidFile
(if any); temporary files are created by the
.I mkstemp(3)
function that enforces a specific file mode on creation regardless
of the process umask.  See
.I umask(2)
for more information.

.TP
.I UserID (string)
Attempts to become the specified userid before starting operations.
The value is of the form
.I userid[:group].
The process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID of
the named
.I userid
unless an alternate
.I group
is specified.
