.SH NAME
.B opendmarc-reports
\- OpenDMARC aggregate report generation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendmarc-reports
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendmarc-reports
pulls data from an OpenDMARC database and generates periodic aggregate
reports.  The database is populated by a running
.B opendmarc-import(8)
on a message history file generated by an
.B opendmarc(8)
filter as messages arrive and are processed.  This includes the collection
of reporting URIs, which this script uses to make reports available to those
that request them.
