Release procedures for OpenDMARC

0) Run "./copyright-check" to ensure anything updated in the current year has
   a current copyright notice in it.

1) Edit configure.ac so that the new release number is formed with the
   VERSION_RELEASE* macros.

2) In the root build directory, do these things:

	% make distclean
	% autoreconf
	% ./configure
	% make
	% make distcheck

   This will produce an opendmarc-(version).tar.gz tarball after running
   all unit tests.

3) Commit changes made to RELEASE_NOTES to the SourceForge git repository.
   Be sure to include any open feature requests, patches or bug fixes
   from the SourceForge trackers.

4) Prepare a release announcement by using the file "announcement" from git
   as your template.  Change the From: to the name and address of the person
   making the announcement.  Make sure that address has permissions to post
   to opendmarc-users and opendmarc-announce.  There should be a paragraph
   or two at the top highlighting the interesting changes and indicating
   what the main focus of this release is (new features, bug fixes, etc.),
   and then the full RELEASE_NOTES block for the new release.  Commit this
   to git.

5) Merge the "develop" branch to the "master" branch, as follows:

	% git checkout master
	% git merge develop
	[massage in and commit any conflicts]
	% git push

6) Deploy all needed files to SourceForge by doing 'make push'.  This will
   also place the release tag.

7) Via the SourceForge UI, make the latest tarball the default download for
   all operating systems.

8) Send the release announcement:

	% sendmail -t < announcement

9) Mark any bug fixes or feature requests, etc. as closed if this release
   contained them.

10) Update our entry on FreshMeat (http://www.freshmeat.net).
