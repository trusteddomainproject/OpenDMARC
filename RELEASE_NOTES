			 OPENDMARC RELEASE NOTES

This listing shows the versions of the OpenDMARC package, the date of
release, and a summary of the changes in that release.

1.4.1		2021/04/29
	NOTE: In response to CVE-2019-20790, opendmarc has changed
		how it evaluates headers added by previous
		SPF milters.  Users are encouraged to read the
		CVE-2019-20790 file in the "SECURITY" folder
		for more details. (#49, #158).  Originally reported by
		Jianjun Chen, feedback by Simon Wilson and
		David BÃ¼rgin <dbuergin@gluet.ch>.
	NOTE: OpenDMARC's internal SPF handling will be removed
		in a future version.  Users are encouraged to
		build linked against libspf2.  Many pre-built 
		packages provided by OS packagers already do this.
		(See https://www.libspf2.org)
	Addition of defines for MUSL C Library. (#129/#133).  Patches by
		Marco Rebhan.
	Updated opendmarc.conf manpage and opendmarc.conf.sample to point to 
		https://publicsuffix.org/list/.
	Added a CONTRIBUTING document.
	Fix two #ifdefs in arc functions for strlcpy. (#138).  Reported by
		Leo Bicknell.
	Fixes to MySQL Schema (#98/#99).  Patch by Bond Keevil.
	LIBSPF2 calls would not compile on OpenBSD due to OpenBSD not 
		having the ns_type definition in arpa/resolv.h.
		Added detection to configure script.  (#134)
	Reworked hcreate_r calls to use hcreate, to compile natively on
		OpenBSD and MacOS. (Part of #94)  Reported by Rupert
		Gallagher.
	Add compatibility with AutoConf 2.70. (#95)  
	Documentation updates about SourceForge being deprecated.  (#101)
	Only accept results from Received-SPF fields that indicate clearly
		which identifier was being evaluated, since DMARC specifically
		only wants results based on MAIL FROM.
        Many build-time fixes (#100, #91, #90, #86, #85, #84, #83, #82, #81)
		Patches provided by Rupert Gallagher (ruga@protonmail.com)
	Added config option HoldQuarantinedMessages (default false), which
		controls if messages with p=quarantine will be passed on to 
		the mail stream (if False) or placed in the MTA's "hold" 
		queue (if True).  Issue #105.  Patch by Marcos Moraes, on
		the OpenDMARC mailing list.

	Override a DMARC "fail" if an ARC "pass" is recorded in conjunction
