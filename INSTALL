			INSTALLING OPENDMARC

OVERVIEW
========

In order to install the opendkim as a milter to an MTA you will need to
perform the following steps:

* Compile the opendmarc program itself.

* Configure the opendmarc filter.

* Install the opendmarc and configure your MTA to use it.

Note that there is a difference between "OpenDMARC" and "opendmarc".
"OpenDMARC" is a package containing a library, a filter and some tools to
be used in testing and using your DMARC installation.  "opendmarc" is the
filter program contained in the "OpenDMARC" package.

libopendmarc is a library available as an API for programmers everywhere.
That API is described in a set of HTML files in the OpenDMARC source code
package.

The opendmarc filter program incorporates the libopendmarc library and works
with recent versions of sendmail and Postfix or any other MTA that supports
"milter".  For more information about milter, see <http://www.milter.org>.

Sendmail is available at <http://www.sendmail.org> and Postfix is available
at <http://www.postfix.org>.


OPTIONAL PACKAGES
=================

OpenDMARC supports a few optional packages that can be included in the build
to provide additional services.  A few of these become mandatory when
enabling certain features below.  Specifying only the "--with-xxx" parameter
to the "configure" command (described below) enables the package and makes a
guess at where it might be installed on your system.  If the configure script
doesn't find it, you will need to specify the location with
"--with-xxx=location".

--with-milter	Sendmail's "milter" include file and library.  Required
		unless compilation of the filter is disabled (see below).
		Enabled by default.

--with-sql-backend
		Names the SQL backend in use on your system.  The default
		is "mysql".  You can also specify "--without-sql-backend"
		to suppres building of SQL support.

FEATURES
========

There are several compile-time features you may select.  Some of these
are present but unsupported while others are fully-supported.  Read the
FEATURES file for a description of the unsupported features.

The supported features are as follows.  The can be turned on at compile
time by adding "--enable-xxx" to the "configure" command line (described
below), where "xxx" is the name of the feature.

filter		Compile the opendmarc filter.  Requires libmilter (see
		"--with-milter" above).  This is on by default; if you
		don't want the filter, specify "--disable-filter".

filter-tests	Includes filter unit tests when doing "make check".
		Requires the "miltertest" program, which is available as
		part of the OpenDKIM package (see http://www.opendkim.org).


COMPILING
=========

The opendmarc filter requires either sendmail v8.13.0 or Postfix v2.3 or later
for required milter protocol enhancements.

As Postfix currently does not provide the milter library, you need to have
sendmail sources or development package installed.  See
http://www.postfix.org/MILTER_README.html

You can view the configuration options with the following command (once you
have built the configure script (see step 3, below)):

	./configure --help

The commands shown below assume a UNIX system with standard build tools
installed.

Steps to compiling the library and the milter:

(1) Download the source from github
    git clone https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC.git

(2) Change directories to the repository directory that
    was created in step 2.
	cd opendmarc-<version>

(3) Run gnu autoreconf to generate the configure and make files.
	autoreconf -v -i

(4) Run the "configure" script to configure the package for your operating
    system.
	./configure

(5) Compile the package.
	make

(6) Install the output of the build.  You probably need to become the
    superuser to run this step.
	make install


CONFIGURING OPENDMARC
=====================

The README document (in the opendmarc directory) covers the installation and
configuration of opendmarc.
